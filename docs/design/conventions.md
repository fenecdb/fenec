# Conventions

The long form of the test and docs conventions [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) lists under *Conventions*: where tests live and which run alone, a test that fails on one run, Chrome's launch, the clock, ports, and what a change a user meets owes the docs. They hold no invariant of the code, so [README.md](README.md#the-original-order) does not number them. Each section below is a bullet moved word for word from CLAUDE.md, which keeps its rule in a sentence or two.

## Test binaries

Unit tests live inline in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`; cross-crate and
protocol tests in `crates/*/tests/`, a file each, gathered into one binary
a crate by `tests/all.rs` (`autotests = false`: a new file needs its `mod`
line there, or it is never built). A test reading the process's own
counts, `/_metrics` or the statements', is a `[[test]]` of its own; so is
one whose servers hold many threads (past macOS's 2 048 a process, a
server answers 503 to whichever test asked), and so are `fenec-http`'s
`tests/audit.rs` and `fenec-shard`'s `tests/refusals.rs`: the wait after a
refusal is the process's, so the other tests' servers ask with none
(`audit::set_delay(0)` in their helpers). Measurement programs are each
crate's `examples/` and `fenec-bench`'s binaries, wired to `make` targets,
not to CI.

## Reruns

A test that fails and passes on a rerun is a bug, the test's or the
code's: reproduce it -- in a loop, under load (`docker run --cpus=3`
beside busy loops is GitHub's three-core runner) -- and fix it, never
retry it away or lengthen a sleep. A test waits for an event, not for a
time: it holds what it races (`Replica.setOnline(false)` before a write it
reads back, a call held under way across a burst, a disk's fsync held at a
gate) and bounds only the wait for something that must happen. A CI log
names every failing test with its assertion (cargo's and `swift test`'s
own output, Gradle's `testLogging`, `dart test`'s GitHub reporter, `node
--test --test-reporter=spec`); a failing mobile job uploads
`test-reports-android` or `test-results-apple` (the simulator's
`.xcresult`).

## Chrome

A step that launches Chrome reads Chrome's own files first, or a cold
runner's disk spends 5 to 20 s of the launcher's wait (`waiting for
dynamic debugging port`): the studio's harness (`warm`) and
`examples/{shop,analytics}/scripts/warm-chrome.mjs` do; a longer wait only
moves the bound.

## The clock

A test reads the clock from below. A sleep never ends early, so `took >=
wait` holds on any machine, while a bound from above measures it: macOS
gives a QoS-clamped job's timers hundreds of milliseconds of leeway
(`taskpolicy -c background` tries it). Where the time is the property -- a
held request answered before its wait, a node that stops once its lease is
out -- the bound is what it stands against, with seconds to spare: half
the wait, the lease the node reports it has left. Elsewhere the test
asserts the event, the count or the order: the wait a refusal would take
(`audit::would_wait`), a grant queued behind another
(`Router::grants_waiting`), the grants a node took while another hangs
(`Router::round_grants`). A timeout a test gives its servers or clients
bounds every request they make, not just the one it is about (a router's
upstream timeout of 600 ms failed a tenant's create at background QoS).

## Ports

A server a test or a harness starts listens on port 0 (`--http
127.0.0.1:0`, `--listen 127.0.0.1:0`, Node's `listen(0)`) and is found by
the `listening on: http://<address>` line on stderr of fenec-server and
fenec-shard (their usage names it, `fenec-shard`'s `tests/listen.rs` holds
it): a fixed port, or one found free and handed over, met another suite's
server. A router is told its nodes by the addresses they said. Only a site
whose address is needed before it binds -- a Next.js build renders it, the
database's CORS names it -- takes a port the system picks, held by a
stand-in listener until the moment it starts (`examples/shop`,
`examples/dispatch`'s `ci.sh`).

## Docs a change owes

A change that adds or alters something a user meets says so where a user
looks, in the same pull request: its reference page under
`site/content/docs/`; README's feature table and the links beside it; the
home page (`site/content/index.html`) and the docs index when a visitor
would pick fenecdb for the feature; and the SDK lists (`languages.html`,
`mobile.html`, `sharding-read-replicas.html`'s SDK paragraph, `integrations.html`'s)
when an SDK changes. A section added or changed is found by its words
alone until the site's search vector cache has its vector: after sections
change, commit the next `site` deploy's `search-embeddings` artifact as
`site/search-embeddings.json` (`gh run download <run> -n
search-embeddings`) where it differs.
