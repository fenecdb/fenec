# Benchmarks

The long form of the invariants [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) lists under *Benchmarks*: what `make scale-bench` and `make ycsb` measure and how. Each section below is a paragraph moved word for word from CLAUDE.md, which keeps its rule in a few sentences and links here; "above" and "below" in them refer to the order the invariants had there, which [README.md](README.md#the-original-order) lists.

## scale-bench

**`make scale-bench` holds fenec-server to pgvector, each over its own
protocol.** fenec-server is asked over HTTP by a keep-alive client written
in the bench crate (`fenec-bench/src/http.rs`), PostgreSQL by the
`postgres` crate with pgvector-rust's types, with the same vectors and m and
ef_construction, and each side takes its best way: fenec-server keeps its
graph as JSON arrays of rows land (`POST /<collection>`), pgvector builds
after a binary COPY in memory on every core (`parallel_workers`: 768-dim
vectors live in TOAST, and PostgreSQL planned one process for them), reads
its index into its buffers and searches a filter with `iterative_scan`; the
container needs 2 GB of shared memory for that build (`pgvector-up`).
At a million 128-dim vectors fenec-server loads and indexes in 49.6 s against
108.5, on 612 MB of disk against 1 432, its engine counting 738 MB against
PostgreSQL's 1 131 (its container's anonymous memory and the shared memory
of its buffers, from its cgroup; macOS puts fenec-server's physical
footprint at 992), answers a beam of 100 with 99.1% recall in 0.141 ms
against 98.6% in 2.08, a filter keeping 1% in 0.67 ms against 16.1, and
eight clients at 18 852 queries/s against 2 289; at 250 000 x 768, 39.9 s
against 79.9 and 99.8% in 0.431 ms against 98.1% in 4.22 (`site/content/docs/benchmarks.html#scale`). The laptop this was
measured on is a fanless M1 Air, which slows to a third under minutes of
load on every core: a comparison runs its sides in turns (`--only fenec`,
then `--only pg`), each after idle minutes, and a figure from a hot run is
not one.

## YCSB

**`make ycsb` is fenecdb as a general database.** YCSB's core workloads
A-F written in the bench crate (`fenec-bench/src/bin/ycsb.rs`) rather than
run through the Java YCSB, to its definitions: ten fields of 100 random
characters, a read the whole record, an update one field, its scrambled
zipfian (0.99, FNV-hashed over ten billion items), its skewed-latest for
D, scans of 1 to 100 records for E. The key is an integer from 1
(`insertorder=ordered`, no `user` prefix), so each system keys by what it
keys best by: `id`, `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, a `bigint` primary key,
`_id`; E's scan is `where id >= $1 limit n`, the id index walked from
the key, no `@sorted`. A key not yet acknowledged is never drawn: an
insert publishes a bound below its key before it takes one (`Keys`).
fenecdb in process against SQLite (a connection a thread, WAL, mapped),
fenec-server over HTTP against PostgreSQL 17 and MongoDB 8, each started
in a container for its turn and removed with its volume, so the VM holds
one at a time; `server-docker` is the same server in a container, which
shows Docker's share -- its network, and an fsync in the VM that is not
macOS's `F_FULLFSYNC`. Durable is an fsync a write in each engine's own
terms (a flush and its durability, `synchronous=FULL` with `fullfsync`,
`synchronous_commit=on`, `j: true`), buffered its default
(`--sync 250`, `NORMAL`, `off`, `j: false`); C writes nothing and runs
once. A server switching modes is stopped with SIGTERM, which syncs: a
kill lost the last 250 ms of the load, and the next update found no row.
Redis 7 (`redis`, redis-rs 1.7.1, a connection a thread) keeps a record
as YCSB's own binding does -- a hash a key, `HGETALL` and `HSET`, every
key in the `_indices` sorted set a scan reads by `ZRANGEBYSCORE` -- but
scored by the key, not a hash of its text, so a scan reads keys in order
as elsewhere, an insert's `HSET` and `ZADD` one `MULTI`/`EXEC` and a
scan's `HGETALL`s one pipeline. Durable is `appendfsync always`,
buffered `everysec`, and `snapshot` -- its image as it comes, RDB
snapshots alone, minutes of writes a crash loses -- a mode of its own
the others pass over (`System::modes`); the default snapshots stay on in
all three, as Redis's persistence page advises. Its container starts
afresh for each load, which ends with a `BGSAVE` and a `BGREWRITEAOF`
run out, so no fork the load made due falls in a cell. After each phase
a container's memory -- `anon` and `shmem` of its cgroup, read through a
container sharing its processes, fenec-server's image having no `cat` --
is a `memory-<phase>` line beside the size. A size read through a
container or a connection of its own -- fenec-server's in Docker, Redis's,
PostgreSQL's -- is read once a cell's clients stop, not every 100 ms
beside them (`System::size_beside`): two `docker run`s a second in the VM
took fenec-server's C at one client from 3.14-3.17 k to 2.33-2.38 k.
benchmarks.html's Redis part
sits between `ycsb redis` markers that `site/build.py` takes out until
the results hold a Redis cell, its figures written in from the medians
(`ycsb_redis`); `ycsb/run-redis.sh` is its run, a `--verify` pass first.
Each cell is 30 s after a 5 s warm-up, and starts once a one-core probe
runs within 4% of its idle time (`cool`), the probe's ratio written with
the cell; the systems take turns with three idle minutes between them.
Latencies go into a log-linear histogram, 64 steps an octave.
`--verify` holds every answer to what was written (`check`): each
thread logs its operations and answers into its own `Vec`, and after the
cell a read must hold, field by field, a value a write that could have
been the last one left (one ended before it and not followed by another
that did, or one overlapping it), a scan consecutive keys as far as it
could see, a write one record -- every write logged, since a read under
concurrent writes is judged by every write's span, and nothing compared
in an operation's time. A pass over all six systems found no mismatch
(`ycsb/verify.tsv`). `ycsb/results.tsv` is the three runs the site
quotes, appended to and never rewritten -- a run's cell measured again
counts as its last line, and a run a later one replaced is named in
`ycsb/superseded.tsv` and counts in no median (`ycsb report`, `site/build.py`)
-- and `site/build.py` holds every YCSB figure on the site to its median
there, the full grid row by row. Docker's VM syncs a
write in 0.08-0.10 ms where the Mac's `F_FULLFSYNC` takes 3.9
(`ycsb/fsync.txt`), so the durable server comparison is `server-docker`
against PostgreSQL and MongoDB, all in the VM, the native server beside
them. fenecdb's buffered reads lost to SQLite's after the updates for the
engine's reason, not the harness's: an update writes the record again at
the file's end, the file outgrew the page cache, and a profile put 86% of
a one-thread read on its page coming in (`ycsb/profile-c1.txt`). Runs
`c1`-`c3` measured fenecdb and fenec-server again with the file compacting
itself (below; the harness starts the engine's `Compactor` as an app's
library does, `--no-auto-compact` for neither): C at one thread 30.1k ->
438k against SQLite's 279k, B 30.8k -> 410k, D 62.6k -> 432k, and fenecdb
ahead of SQLite in every in-process cell; the buffered file stood at 3.7-4.0
GB after D, between compacts of a file A grows by 100 MB a second. Official
YCSB 0.17.0 against the same containers came within -14% to +2% of the
harness (`ycsb/calibration/`). Docker's network moves from day to day --
PostgreSQL's C at one client was 3.34 k, 3.00 k and 3.53 k on three -- so
the one-client server cells were measured again on 2026-10-04 with
PostgreSQL beside them in turns, under the same run ids (`c1`-`c3`,
`r1`-`r3`), each cell counting as its run's last line. `make
roundtrip-bench` took the round trip apart: of a 0.29 ms read in Docker
about 0.25 is Docker's port forwarding, the server's part 0.023 ms and
PostgreSQL's bind and execute 0.016, so the published guess that a binary
protocol answers sooner was not the cause; the durable gap was the fsync
of a growing file (the sync log, above): durable A 2.24 k -> 3.27 k at one
client against PostgreSQL's 2.60 k, even at 16. E's scans were
fenec-server's own -- 213-220 us inside for 50 rows, 37 page faults --
and a plain `get` written as JSON from the stored rows (below) took E at
one client 1.03 k -> 1.62 k buffered against 1.34 k, 1.06 k -> 1.82 k
durable against 1.39 k. B, C, D and E were measured again on 2026-10-05,
servers and PostgreSQL in turns under the same ids, run 1 again on a quiet
machine after its idle probe was taken at a load of five; C stays 3.19 k
against 3.66 k, with each server's part of a read under 0.02 of 0.29 ms
and PostgreSQL's own B at 2.65 k beside its C: the rest moves with the VM.
Then every server cell, 1, 4 and 16 clients, was measured in one night,
2026-10-13 (`rx1`-`rx3`: fenec-server natively and in Docker, PostgreSQL,
MongoDB and Redis in turns), superseding the servers' `c`, PostgreSQL's
and MongoDB's `r` runs and the `rd` attempt sized beside the cells: the
server in Docker leads the other three in every cell but buffered C and
F at one client, 3.07 k against PostgreSQL's 3.14 k and 2.07 k against
2.09 k, and Redis in every one.
