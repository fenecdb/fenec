# The fenecdb website

Dusk in the dune field. The fennec is a desert fox — nocturnal, very fast — so
the site is a night sky over lit dunes, with the vector space drawn as the star
field it mathematically resembles. Everything that moves is either the real
engine running or a real measurement being drawn.

The generator (`build.py`) is standard library only, in keeping with the repo's
zero-dependency rule; it exists so that page chrome lives in one place instead
of being copied into fifteen files and drifting.

```bash
make site          # -> site/dist
make site-serve    # build, then http://localhost:8788
make site-deploy   # build, then wrangler deploy
```

All three depend on `make wasm`: the console on the home page runs the real
engine, so `build.py` copies `web/fenec.js` and `web/fenec.wasm` into the
output. Without them the console falls back to the published measurements and
says so on screen.

## Deployment

Cloudflare Workers, assets-only — there is no `main` in `wrangler.jsonc`, so
every request is answered from `site/dist` by the static-asset router. Same
shape as `apps/site` in the backlex repo, including its two hard-won rules:

- **Routes are not declared in `wrangler.jsonc`.** A deploy token with Workers
  Scripts permissions but without *Zone › Workers Routes* uploads the worker and
  the assets fine and then fails reconciling the route (Authentication error
  10000). The routes for `fenecdb.com` are stable, so they stay
  dashboard-managed and CI deploys cleanly. To move them into the config, grant
  the token *Zone › Workers Routes › Edit* on the zone.
- **The apex needs its own proxied A/AAAA record.** A `*.fenecdb.com` wildcard
  does not cover `fenecdb.com`.

`.github/workflows/site.yml` builds the wasm and deploys on a push to `main`
that touches `site/`, `wrangler.jsonc` or the crates the module is built from.
It needs two repository secrets: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (the *Edit Cloudflare
Workers* template) and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. Neither is committed — no
`account_id` lives in the config, so `wrangler` resolves it from the login
session locally and from the environment in CI.

Locally, `wrangler login` once, then `make site-deploy`.

`site/dist/_headers` is written by `build.py` on every build: security headers
for everything, an hour of caching for CSS and JS, and revalidation for
`fenec.wasm` — the filename is stable across builds, and a stale module would
silently be the wrong engine.

## Layout

```
site/
  build.py        the generator
  template.html   the page shell; {{placeholders}} are filled per page
  styles.css      the whole design system
  site.js         the scene, the live console, the race, docs navigation
  content/
    index.html    the home page
    404.html      served by not_found_handling
    docs/*.html   one fragment per docs page
  dist/           generated output, gitignored
```

## Adding a docs page

1. Write `content/docs/<name>.html`, starting with the metadata comment:

   ```html
   <!--
   title: Thing — fenecdb
   description: One sentence, used for the meta description and link previews.
   -->

   <h1>Thing</h1>
   <p class="kicker">One or two sentences under the title.</p>
   ```

2. Add it to `NAV` in `build.py`, under the group it belongs to. That list
   drives the sidebar order and the previous/next links at the foot of a page.

Every `<h2>` and `<h3>` gets an id and a table-of-contents entry automatically;
write your own `id="..."` when another page already links to it.

## Conventions

- Code goes in `<pre data-lang="fenecql|js|rust|bash|json|http|text">`, with an
  optional `data-label="filename"`. Write `<` and `>` raw; the generator
  escapes and highlights. `data-bare` highlights in place without the panel —
  that is how the typed headline on the home page is set.
- Tables: wrap in `<div class="tbl">` and mark numeric cells `class="n"` so
  they align right and never wrap across two lines.
- `<div class="note">` for something worth knowing, `<div class="note trap">`
  for something that will bite. Both are cheap, so neither should be common.
- Add `class="rise"` to reveal a block on scroll. Anything inside `.strata`
  reveals itself.
- Every number needs its method nearby. The repo is careful about this and the
  site has to be too, or it stops being trustworthy.

## Motion, and what it costs

`prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured throughout: the sky canvases stop, the
headline appears whole, the race jumps to its finish, and nothing translates.

Two things were measured and fixed, and are worth not reintroducing:

- **A full-viewport `mix-blend-mode` overlay froze the renderer.** Blending a
  fixed layer over two animating canvases forces a whole-page CPU composite
  every frame. The grain is painted into the page background instead.
- **`filter: blur()` on a large animated element re-rasterises it every frame.**
  The horizon glow is a soft radial gradient with no filter.

Both canvases stop entirely once the hero scrolls out of view, and while the tab
is hidden.
